## Exercise: prove that the interval $[0, 1)$ is not open

**Hint:** Recall how to expand definitions. You can for instance use
```
Expand the definition of open.
```
to use the definition of open in one of the assumptions.

**Hint:** Recall that you can use
```
We claim that (...).
{
  (* proof of claim here *)
}
```
to make a claim and prove it.
```coq
Lemma not_open : Â¬ ([0,1) is _open_).
Proof.
```
<input-area>
```coq
It suffices to show that (Â¬(âˆ€ a âˆˆ [0,1), a is an _interior point_ of [0,1))).
Assume that (âˆ€ a âˆˆ [0,1), a is an _interior point_ of [0,1)).
It holds that (âˆ€ a âˆˆ [0, 1), âˆƒ r > 0, âˆ€ x âˆˆ B(a, r), x âˆˆ [0, 1)) (i).
Use a := (0) in (i).
{ Indeed, (0 âˆˆ [0,1)). }
It holds that (âˆƒ r > 0, âˆ€ x âˆˆ B(0, r), x âˆˆ [0, 1)) (iii).
Obtain such a r.
It holds that (âˆ€ x âˆˆ B(0,r), x âˆˆ [0,1)) (ii).
Use x := (0) in (ii).
{ We need to verify that (0 âˆˆ B(0, r)).
  It suffices to show that (|0 - 0| < r).
  It holds that (r > 0).
  We conclude that (|0 - 0| < r).
}
It holds that (0 âˆˆ [0,1)).
We claim that ((0 - (r/2)) âˆˆ B(0,r)).
{
  We need to show that ((0-(r/2)) âˆˆ B(0,r)).
  It suffices to show that (|0 - (r/2) - 0| < r).
  We conclude that (& |0 - (r/2) - 0| = r/2 < r).
}
It holds that ((0-(r/2)) âˆˆ B(0,r)).
By (ii) it holds that ((0-(r/2)) âˆˆ [0,1)).
Contradiction.

## Exercise: prove that the interval $[0, 1)$ is not open

**Hint:** Recall how to expand definitions. You can for instance use
```
Expand the definition of open.
```
to use the definition of open in one of the assumptions.

**Hint:** Recall that you can use
```
We claim that (...).
{
  (* proof of claim here *)
}
```
to make a claim and prove it.
```coq
Lemma not_open : ¬ ([0,1) is _open_).
Proof.
```
<input-area>
```coq
It suffices to show that (¬ (∀ a, [0, 1) a ⇨ a is an _interior point_ of [0, 1))).
Assume that (∀ a, [0, 1) a ⇒ a is an _interior point_ of [0, 1)).
It holds that (∀ a, [0,1) a ⇒ a is an _interior point_ of [0, 1)) (i).
Use a := (0) in (i).
It holds that ([0, 1) 0 ⇒ 0 is an _interior point_ of [0, 1)).
It holds that (0 ∈ [0,1)).
It holds that (0 is an _interior point_ of [0,1)).
It holds that (∃ r > 0, ∀ x ∈ B(0, r), x ∈ [0, 1)) (ii).
Obtain r according to (ii).
It holds that (∀ x ∈ B(0,r), x ∈ [0,1)) (iii).
Use x := (1) in (iii).
{ We need to verify that (1 ∈ B(0, r)).
  We need to show that (1 ∈ B(0, r)).
  It holds that (r > 0).
  It suffices to show that (|1 - 0| < r).
  We conclude that (|1 - 0| < r).
}
It holds that (1 ∈ [0, 1)).

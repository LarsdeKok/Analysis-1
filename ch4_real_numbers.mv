## Exercise 4.9.1
```coq
Lemma ex_4_9_1 : ∀ a ∈ ℝ, ∀ b ∈ ℝ, a < b ⇒
    a is the infimum of [a,b).
Proof.
```
<input-area>
```coq
Take a ∈ (ℝ).
Take b ∈ (ℝ).
Assume that (a<b).
We need to show that (a is the _infimum_ of [a,b)).

We need to show that (a is a _lower bound_ for [a,b) ∧ (∀l∈ℝ, l is a _lower bound_ for [a,b) ⇒ l≤a)).
We show both statements.
* We need to show that (a is a _lower bound_ for [a,b)).
  We conclude that (a is a _lower bound_ for [a,b)).
* We need to show that (∀l∈ℝ, l is a _lower bound_ for [a,b) ⇒ l≤a).
  Take l ∈ (ℝ).
  Assume that (l is a _lower bound_ for [a,b)).
  We conclude that (l ≤ a).

## Exercise 4.9.2
```coq
Section ex_4_9_2.

Variable A : subset(ℝ).
Hypothesis A_bdd_above : (∃ b ∈ ℝ, b is an _upper bound_ for A).
Hypothesis A_nonempty : (∃ a ∈ ℝ, a ∈ A).

Lemma ex_4_9_2 : ∀ y ∈ ℝ, (y is the _supremum_ of A) ∧ (y ∈ A) ⇒
  y is the _maximum_ of A.
Proof.
```
<input-area>
```coq
Take y ∈ (ℝ).
We need to show that (y is the _supremum_ of A ∧ y ∈ A ⇨ y is the _maximum_ of A).
Assume that (y is the _supremum_ of A ∧ y ∈ A).

## Exercise 4.9.3
```coq
Lemma ex_4_9_3 : 4 is the supremum of [0,4).
Proof.
```
<hint title="💡 Hint (click to open/close)">To use the *alternative characterization* of the supremum, write

`It suffices to show that ((4 is an upper bound for [0,4))
  ∧ (∀ ε > 0, ∃ a ∈ [0, 4), 4 - ε < a)).`</hint><input-area>
```coq
It suffices to show that ((4 is an upper bound for [0,4)) ∧ (∀ ε > 0, ∃ a ∈ [0, 4), 4 - ε < a)).
We show both statements.
* We need to show that (4 is an upper bound for [0,4)).
  We conclude that (4 is an upper bound for [0,4)).
* We need to show that (∀ε>0, ∃a∈[0,4), 4-ε<a).
  Take ε > 0.
  Choose a := (4-(1/(ε+1))).
  - We need to verify that (a ∈ [0,4)).
    Since (ε > 0) it holds that (ε+1>1).
    It holds that (1/(ε+1)>0).
    It holds that (& a = 4-(1/(ε+1)) < 4).
    Since (ε > 0) it holds that (1/(ε+1) > 0).
    It holds that (1/(ε+1) < 1).
    It holds that (& a = 4-(1/(ε+1)) ≥ 0).
    Indeed, (a ∈ [0,4)).
  - We need to show that(4-ε<a). 
    It suffices to show that (4-ε < 4 - 1/(ε+1)).
    It suffices to show that (ε > 1/(ε+1)).
    Since (ε > 0) it holds that (ε+1 > 1).
    It holds that (ε > 1 / (ε + 1)).
